DevNet version 1.0 (December 2009 - January 2010)
Author: Feni Varughese (feni.110mb.com)

About:
DevNet is a PHP collaboration tool website where programmers and others involved in software development can collaborate and share expertise. It differs greatly from current open source project hosting sites like sourceforge and google-code-hosting in that it focus on smaller taks associated with a project rather than trying to tackle an entire project in itself. 
It's essentially like stack-overflow for code (instead of simply answers to questions) where users post a description of a problem with a given api (in a black-box fashion) and commenters post possible implementations, which are then voted on. Users earn points this way which they can then use to aquire help on their own projects (there are 2 types of points. Bragging rights through non-spendable experience points, like reddit karma, and usueful points that could be spent (given to other coders) for help). 
There is a plan to implement an underlying code management system like SVN or GIT, but it hasn't been implemented yet. 

Project Details:
The website is powered by PHP & mySQL. This was my first project with PHP, so a lot of the code isn't very optimal or elegent. Another newbie mistake I made was that I built the mySQL database by hand (using phpMyAdmin) instead of using a script, so I can no-longer re-create it. I do plan on returning to the project and refactoring the code and making a script for the database eventually, once I get a few other pressing projects out of the way. 
The site never went online since it was just a winter-break project and I didn't have the resources to host it anywhere. Maybe someday...

The site currently has an account management system and a project (module) management system with basic capabilities for points and ranking (for both projects and users).
